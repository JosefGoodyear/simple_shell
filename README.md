# Josef and Tu's Shell
***
### Description
Josef and Tu's Shell is a shell that replicates functionalities of the simple shell. Additional functions are also included.

### Installation
Clone this repository into your working directory. For best results, files should be compiled with GCC and the following flags: -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -Wno-format.

### Usage
After compilation, the resulting program can run stand-alone, either in interactive or non-interactive mode. 

#### Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, simply run the program and wait for the prompt to appear. From there, you can type commands freely, exiting with either the "exit" command or ctrl-D.

#### Non-Interactive Mode
In non-interactive mode, echo your desired command and pipe it into the program like this:
```BASH
echo "ls" | ./shell
```BASH
In non-interactive mode, the program will exit after finishing your desired command(s).
